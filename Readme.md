This repo contains an analysis of the Pycity School dataset; which highlights the school peformance, spending per student, and school size

Conclusions are as follows..

With my observation schools that spend more on their students did not necessairly have better average scores. Moderate spending did however have a better performance than both lowest and highest spending brackets.Another observation that I noted is that smaller schools show higher overall passing rates compared to larger schools. 
This was done in Pthon using Pandas, with the results in Jupyter Notebook
